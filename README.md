# From-BillBoard-To-Spotify
Create playlists of top 100 songs according to Billboard on Spotify.  
This program takes a date as input from the user, then using Beautiful Soup, it scrapes the Billboard hot-100 songs for the week with that date.  
Using the data collected, the program then searches spotify for those songs and adds them to a playlist linked to the user's account (Authorization Required!).
